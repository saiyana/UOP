# Customer Feedback and Sentiment Analysis

**Project Definition:** </br>
Feedback about a product or a service or both is a very important aspect of customer satisfaction for any firm. The idea of this project is to build an application that crawls the entire web to find and analyze references to “Chase” and categorize the feedback given.
With so much feedback it will be good to have an algorithm which takes the data of customer feedback(either by crawling web or manual input of tweets/posts on social media) and identifies the most important topics customers of chase spoke about, summarize it. As an additional feature, it can also perform sentiment analysis to give if the feedback is positive or negative on a particular product of chase.

**Preferred Modules:**</br>
* Web application that is internal to Chase to crawl the internet and find references and categorize feedback.
* Identify the customer friends/family through Social media (Facebook, twitter etc) and identify non-chase customers to offer various products.

**How this project would benefit the students:** </br>
* Web crawlers, optimization of the time and resource of the crawler.
* Understanding of the data analytics, pattern matching, report generations.
* Future enhancements, suggestion guessing and possible scenario generations.

**How this project would benefit the End user/Customer:**</br>
By capturing, analyzing the customers feedback, this application helps us to further refine and better the existing customer servicing.
